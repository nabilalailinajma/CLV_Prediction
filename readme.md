# Predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for Car Insurance

Develop by : Nabila Lailinajma

## Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model to estimate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for Drivesure Insurance, a vehicle insurance company. CLV is a crucial metric that helps businesses understand the long-term value of their customers, enabling better customer acquisition strategies, improved retention efforts, and maximized profitability.

## Business Understanding
Drivesure Insurance operates in the competitive vehicle insurance industry, where understanding customer value is essential for sustainable growth. The company faces challenges in identifying high-value customers for targeted marketing, reducing churn by improving retention strategies, and optimizing pricing and policy offerings. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this study seeks to predict CLV accurately and offer actionable insights to enhance business decision-making.

## Problem Statement
- Customer Value Differentiation: How can the company identify high-value customers versus low-value ones?
- Retention Optimization: How can CLV predictions help in improving customer retention strategies?
- Profit Maximization: How can CLV models contribute to better resource allocation for customer acquisition and retention?

## Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance will be evaluated using the following metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual CLV values.
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): Expresses the prediction error as a percentage, useful for comparing performance across different scales.
- R-squared (R²): Indicates the proportion of variance in CLV explained by the model, with higher values signifying better performance.
